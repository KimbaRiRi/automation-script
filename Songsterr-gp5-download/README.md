# Songsterr-saver

This is a code created to download notes in gp5 format from the Songsterr website. When I found the python code from https://github.com/Irurnnen/Songsterr-saver, it did not work well. The main reason is that Songsterr changed their JSON structure to request data. So I changed the structure accordingly. 

## Installation

For the code to work, you need to download the necessary libraries.

```bash
pip install -r -requirements.txt
```
To run it, run the python command 
```bash
python main.py
```
